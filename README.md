# Planner API

Api for my personal Android planner App. Currently having:
- Token authentication
- CRUD: Todo tasks with title and descriptions fields
- CRUD: Time blocks with start and end fields, can be linked to a task and to calculate the total time spent on that task

Planning to
- Schedule todo tasks for a day
- Return tasks only for the requested day, week, etc.

The frontend is also under development: https://github.com/uwjikjyhj/planner-app
